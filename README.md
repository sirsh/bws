compile with make (see make file for simple compile line)

run using bws.exe > out.data

python .\scripts\post_proc.py can be used to process the out.data. It is pretty basic stariting point 
that assumes the output file is exactly called out.data and it asks for a name of an experiment to generate other files. 
It foreces you to enter in case you accidentally overwrite files
